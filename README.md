# Extension Methods

## Description
This project contains a set of extension methods for the String class, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) to test these methods.

## Features

- CapitalizeWords: This method capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string.
- RemoveVowels: This method removes all the vowels from the string.
- WordCount: This method returns the number of words in the string.
- WordLengths: This method returns an array containing the lengths of individual words in the string.
- IsSentence: This method returns true or false, indicating whether the string is a sentence (starts with a capital letter and ends with a period).
- MostFrequentLetter: This method returns the letter that appears most frequently in the string.
